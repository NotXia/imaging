# Imaging
## Introduction
Project for the Calculus course at the University of Bologna (A.Y. 2021-2022).

### Description
The assignment is to implement and analyze the behaviour of the image deblurring problem expressed as a minimum least square problem.\
The Conjugate gradient and the Gradient descent method are used to minimize the loss function.\
Tikhonov and Total variation regularization are used to improve the result.

## Usage
The implementation and the experiments are in the `progetto.ipynb` notebook.\
To install the dependencies run: 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
